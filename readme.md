These are unofficial targets for [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav).
Some of the targets provide support for flight controller boards that do not have official INAV support.
Others add features to boards that are supported, such as adding PINIO or extra servo outputs.

Targets can be found in [src/main/target/](src/main/target/)

Targets available here include:

GEPRCF722
GRAVITYF7
IFLIGHTF7_SXEMINI
MATEKF405SE_PINIO
MATEKF405SE_PINIO2
OMNIBUSF4_PINIO:
OMNIBUSF4_PINIOPRO
OMNIBUSF4_PINIOV3
OMNIBUSF4_PINIOV3_S5_S6_2SS
OMNIBUSF4_PINIOV3_S5S6_SS
OMNIBUSF4_PINIOV3_S6_SS
SKYSTARSF405hd
SKYSTARSF722HDPRO
and more

New additions are very much welcomed. If you've made your own target, please
send a pull request or send me a zip of your files and I'll add it here.
Improvements are also very much welcomed. Any additions or improvements you
make, please send a PR or let me know.

Here is some information about how you can make your own target, either to support
an FC that isn't already supported, or to remap resources:
[Building Custom Firmware](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Building-custom-firmware)

[Mosca's script](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/tree/mosca-target-converter/src/utils) can help make a new INAV target from an existing Betaflight target.

Getting a new target added to the *offical* inav distribution has certain
[requirements](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/policies/NEW_HARDWARE_POLICY.md).
On the other hand, all targets are welcome here.

Please add in your target folder a readme.txt file saying what your target is for and how you've tested it.

# PosHold, Navigation and RTH without compass PSA

Attention all drone pilots and enthusiasts,

Are you ready to take your flights to new heights with INAV 7.1? We've got some important information to share with you.

INAV 7.1 brings an exciting update to navigation capabilities. Now, you can soar through the skies, navigate waypoints, and even return to home without relying on a compass. Yes, you heard that right! But before you launch into the air, there's something crucial to consider.

While INAV 7.1 may not require a compass for basic navigation functions, we strongly advise you to install one for optimal flight performance. Here's why:

üõ∞Ô∏è Better Flight Precision: A compass provides essential data for accurate navigation, ensuring smoother and more precise flight paths.

üåê Enhanced Reliability: With a compass onboard, your drone can maintain stability even in challenging environments, low speeds and strong wind.

üöÄ Minimize Risks: Although INAV 7.1 can get you where you need to go without a compass, flying without one may result in a bumpier ride and increased risk of drift or inaccurate positioning.

Remember, safety and efficiency are paramount when operating drones. By installing a compass, you're not just enhancing your flight experience, but also prioritizing safety for yourself and those around you.

So, before you take off on your next adventure, make sure to equip your drone with a compass. It's the smart choice for smoother flights and better navigation.

Fly safe, fly smart with INAV 7.1 and a compass by your side!

Note we cannot generally provide support for the code here. This is just a 
collection of targets that have been contributed by people like you. The maintainer
of this repository (Sensei) didn't write this code and may not own the hardware.
The only exception is Airbot Omnibus boards. The maintainer of this repo
does own Omnibus flight controllers and is familiar with ONLY those boards.

These files are not a product of the official inav project and are not endorsed
by the project or affiliated with it. These files may or may not work well for you.
They have been provided by people who made them for their own use and report that the files work for them.
